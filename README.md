Task 0: a function that produces output according to a format.

 - Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
 - Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
 - write output to stdout, the standard output stream
 - format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
